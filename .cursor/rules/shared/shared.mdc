# Shared Layer Rules (Hard-Fail)

- `app/shared/**` is only for cross-domain reusable code.
- Domain-specific logic (events/community/dashboard) must stay in module folders.
- Shared utilities/components/hooks/models must remain generic and dependency-safe across domains.

If code is feature-specific, move it from shared to the owning module.
