# Module Components Rules (Hard-Fail)

- Components are UI building blocks for a feature.
- Components should not directly own route redirects/orchestration.
- Avoid direct Supabase/data SDK calls in components
- Avoid direct model types in components, use them in model folders of modules or shared
- Keep components focused on rendering and local interaction concerns.
- Make sure components are not bloated and execute only one thing. Clear seperation is important

If data/orchestration is misplaced in components, require extraction to route/repo/hook.
