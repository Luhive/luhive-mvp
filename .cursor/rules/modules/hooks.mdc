# Module Hooks Rules (Hard-Fail)

- Hooks orchestrate client-side feature behavior/state.
- Hooks may call repos for client-driven flows, but should not perform route-level redirects.
- Keep hooks feature-scoped; move cross-domain logic to `app/shared/hooks/**`.
- Keep hook APIs concise and domain-oriented.

If hook logic crosses route or shared boundaries, propose compliant refactor path.
