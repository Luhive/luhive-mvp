# Model Purity Rules (Hard-Fail)

`model/` is domain definition, not runtime orchestration.

- `schema`: validation contracts (e.g. Zod).
- `types`: domain TypeScript contracts.
- `models`: domain structured types/constants when needed.
- `meta`: route metadata builders.

Keep model files dependency-light and side-effect free.
Reject adding data fetching, redirects, or UI orchestration in model layer.
