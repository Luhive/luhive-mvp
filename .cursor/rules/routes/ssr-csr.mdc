# SSR vs CSR Decisions

- Prefer `loader/action` for auth-sensitive reads/writes, redirects, and cookie-aware flows.
- Prefer `clientLoader + module hooks` for intentionally client-driven interactive pages.
- Use `useFetcher()` for non-navigation form/API interactions.
- Route handles orchestration; repo handles data access; component handles UI.

If SSR/CSR responsibilities are mixed incorrectly, propose corrected split before coding.
