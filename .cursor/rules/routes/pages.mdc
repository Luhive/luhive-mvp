# Page Route Rules

- Route files own page composition and route behavior.
- Allowed exports include `loader`, `action`, `meta`, `clientLoader`, `default`.
- Route should call module repos/hooks/components/models, not inline domain data layer logic.
- Do not move page UI ownership into module `page.tsx` patterns.
- Route page should be directive and single source of truth
- Route page should be neat and not bloated. It should be broke down components and be a bridge between loader, action data and components.

Reject proposals that shift route orchestration into modules or repos.
