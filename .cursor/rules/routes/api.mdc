# API Resource Route Rules (Hard-Fail)

- API endpoints live in `app/routes/api/**` as resource routes.
- Keep route handlers focused on request/response orchestration.
- Delegate reusable domain/data logic to module server/data layers.
- Do not embed UI concerns in API/resource route files.

If structure conflicts with these boundaries, rewrite to compliant layering.
