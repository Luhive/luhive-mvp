# Core Architecture (Hard-Fail)

- Pages and route composition belong in `app/routes/**`.
- Modules provide domain logic/components; modules do not define route tree.
- Repos are data-focused; routes orchestrate redirects/errors/page data shape.
- Shared code must be cross-domain and generic only.
- Code pieces shouldn't be bloated. They should be arranged and splitted under corresponding module's - components, server, repo, models
- Every chunk of code or file should do one and only thing
- Do not use exported interfaces, models, types in the hooks or components or pages. We have shared and module models folders

If a proposed change violates these boundaries, stop and provide a compliant rewrite first.
Keep responses concise and avoid repeating architecture text unless needed.


- Never let slow data block fast content from rendering
